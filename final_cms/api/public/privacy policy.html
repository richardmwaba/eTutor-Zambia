		<h2 align="center">Privacy Policy</h2>
		
		
		<p style="text-align:justify">
		Your privacy is key to eTutor so we have established a Privacy Policy that spells out how we collect, 
		use, disclose, transfer, and store your personal information. In addition to this Privacy Policy, 
		we provide data
		and privacy information imbedded in our products for certain features that ask 
		to use your personal information. 
		
		</p>
		
		</div>

        <div id="header">
		<h4>Collection and Use of Personal Information</h4>
				
		<p>
		Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person. <br><br>
        You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with eTutor. 
		Combining this information with other information eTutor may utilize it to provide and improve our products,
		services and content.<br><br>
        Here are some examples of the types of personal information eTutor may collect and how we may use it:
		
		</p>
		
		</div>	
 
        <div id="">
		<h4>Personal information</h4>
				
		<p>
		When you create an eTutor user ID in order to access our various content or register for a class at an eTutor, 
		contact us or participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your 
		name and phone number location information.<br><br>
        When you share your content with family and friends using eTutor products, or invite others to participate in eTutor platforms,
		eTutor may collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone number.
		eTutor will use such information to fulfill your requests, provide the relevant product or service, or for anti-fraud purposes

		
		</p>
		
		</div>			
				
		<div id="">
		<h4>Use of your personal information</h4>
		
		<p style="text-align:justify">
		We may process your personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy with your consent, 
	   for compliance with a legal obligation to which eTutor is subject or when we have assessed it is necessary for 
	   the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by eTutor or a third party to whom it may be necessary to disclose information.<br><br>
       The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on eTutor's latest product announcements, and upcoming events.
	   If you don't want to be on our mailing list, you can opt out anytime by updating your preferences.<br><br>
       We may use your personal information,including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with identification of users, 
	   and to determine appropriate services. For example, we may use
	   date of birth to determine the age of eTutor ID account holders.<br><br>
       From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and 
	   changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with eTutor, 
	   you may not opt out of receiving these communications.<br><br>
       We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to 
	   improve eTutor's products, services, <br> and customer communications.
		
		</p>
		
		</div>	
		
		<div id="">
		<h4>Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information</h4>
		
		
		<p style="text-align:justify">
		We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer,
		and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. 
		The following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:<br><br>
        We may collect information such as occupation, language, unique device identifier, referrer URL, 
		location, and the time zone where an eTutor product is used so that we can better understand customer 
		behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising. This information is aggregated and used to
		help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest.
		Aggregated data is considered non-personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.<br><br>
		
        With your explicit consent, we may collect data about how you use the platform in order to help app developers improve the app.<br><br>
        If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal 
		information for as long as it remains combined.

		</div>	
		
		<div id="">
		<h4>Cookies and Other Technologies</h4>
		
		<p style="text-align:justify">
		eTutor's websites, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use "cookies" and other technologies.
		These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, 
		and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. 
		We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information.
		However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these <br> 
		identifiers as personal information. 
		Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, 
		we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.<br><br>
        eTutor and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications.<br> 
		Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with eTutor more convenient and personal. 
		For example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the eTutor Online Store. <br><br>

		This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), 
		referring and exit websites and applications, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.<br><br>

		<h4>Protection of Personal Information</h4>

       When your personal data is stored by eTutor, we use computer systems with limited access housed in facilities using physical security measures. <br><br>
       When you use some eTutor products, services, or applications or post on an eTutor forum, chat room, or social networking service, 
	   the personal information and content you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them. You are responsible for the 
	   personal information you choose to share or submit in these instances. For example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, 
	   that information is public. Please take care when using these features.

		<h4>The existence of Automated Decision-Making, Including Profiling</h4>

		We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy 
		and our service specific privacy summaries. 
		When assessing these periods we carefully examine our need to collect personal information at all and if we establish a 
		relevant need we only retain it for the shortest

		<h4>Children & Education</h4>
		
		
		<p style="text-align:justify">
		We understand the importance of taking extra precautions to protect the privacy and safety of children using eTutor products and services. 
		Children under the age of 12, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, are not permitted to create their own eTutor IDs, 
		unless their parent provided verifiable consent or as part of the child account creation process in Family Sharing or they have obtained
		a Managed eTutor ID account (where available) through their school. For example, a parent must review the eTutor ID and Family Sharing 
		Disclosure and agree to the Consent to eTutor's Collection, Use and Disclosure of Your Child's Information; and the Terms and Conditions, 
		before they can begin the eTutor ID account creation process for their child. In addition, schools that participate in eTutor's corporate 
		learning programme and have reviewed and consented to the Managed eTutor IDs for Students Disclosure may create Managed eTutor IDs for students. <br><br>
		
       If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 13, or equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction, outside 
	   the above circumstances we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. <br><br>
       If at any time a parent needs to access, correct, or delete data associated with their Family Sharing account or child's eTutor 
	   ID, they may contact us through one of the options provided at the bottom of this page.
