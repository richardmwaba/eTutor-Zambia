### What is this repository for? ###

New app file structure that includes that new CMS site to be powered by the MEAN stack. The folder <em>app</em> holds the 
mobile app source code and is the same as the last commit that was made.

<strong>etutor-CMS</strong>, holds all the source code to that deals with the CMS.

### How do I get set up? ###
<h3>Setup</h3>
We all know the way to set up ionic. PS: there is an update to the ionic Cli better update it.

To set up the etutor-cms, go into the dir <kbd>cd etutor-cms</kbd>, then run <kbd>npm install</kbd> that will get all the
dependencies you need. <strong>Note</strong>: Is you are using a new dependency make sure to add the <em>--save</em> flag
so that it can be saved to the package.json file. 

You will also notice that inside the <strong>etutor-CMS</strong> folder there is an <em>angular-src</em> folder. This folder will
hold all our angular related source code for the CMS site. You will also need to install the dependencies for angular as well.
We are using Angular 4 for dev in this project so make sure to update your angular-cli (it gives a lot of issues if t]you dont update it).
