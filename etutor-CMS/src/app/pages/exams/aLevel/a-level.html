            Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life--think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain,
            muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the
            way to success.

            People who succeed have momentum. The more they succeed, the more they want to succeed, and the more they find a
            way to succeed. Similarly, when someone is failing, the tendency is to get on a downward spiral that can even
            become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

            The reason most people never reach their goals is that they don't define them, or ever seriously consider them as
            believable or achievable. Winners can tell you where they are going, what they plan to do along the way, and who
            will be sharing the adventure with them.

            You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that
            the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something--your gut, destiny, life, karma,
            whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.
